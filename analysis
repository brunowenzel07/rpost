He was sharpened up by the refitted cheekpieces and saw this trip out strongly.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Fire In Babylon</b> made progress from the rear without ever getting close to challenge. This was more encouraging and he is one to follow when hitting form.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Iguacu</b> confirmed the promise shown over C&D earlier in the month but is not getting any younger and last won on the Flat in September 2012.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Olivers Mount</b>, patiently ridden to get the longer trip, was travelling as well as anything turning for home but did not really close when asked for his effort. He&acute;s well treated but did not see this out.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Nolecce</b>, down to a fair mark judged on his form of a couple of seasons ago, chased the leader turning for home but could only plug on at the one pace.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Well Owd Mon</b>, a dual C&D winner, found little when coming under pressure down the far side and did not give his running. The stewards noted the trainer could offer no explanation for the gelding&acute;s performance, while the vet reported that a post-race examination failed to reveal any abnormalities. [Matt Boyle]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> <b class="black">Ninepointsixthree</b> has been slow to mature mentally but we&acute;ve always thought he was a nice horse.

He travelled like the best horse and was never in any danger having been sent on 1f out. This consistent winner improved for the step up in trip and can progress from here.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Two Jabs</b>, 2lb higher than when scoring over C&D on his penultimate start, made a bold bid from the front and kept on well enough for pressure but bumped into a fair type.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Swing Alone</b>, 4lb lower than when scoring at Lingfield last December, moved well turning for home but did not see this out as well as the front two.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Jacobs Son</b>, who had shown his best form on the Fibresand, was under pressure from an early stage and could never get competitive.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Rex Whistler</b>, up in grade and 5lb higher than when off the mark over C&D in October, found this tough enough having come under pressure 3f out.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Lexington Bay</b>, with the cheekpieces back on, arrived in decent form but disappointed on this Tapeta debut. The vet found that the gelding was lame behind. [Matt Boyle]<br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div><div class="nodataBlock"><h5>No data found</h5></div>Four withdrawals took plenty of interest out of this maiden which was run at a sound pace.<br /><br /> <b class="black">EXCELLENT GEORGE</b> confirmed the promise shown at Chelmsford on his previous start with an all-the-way success. He travelled kindly in front before quickening smartly 2f out to put the race to bed. He had a fitness advantage over his main rivals but did this well and should handle the step into handicaps.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Dawn&acute;s Early Light</b>, whose price rose to 60,000GBP as a yearling, is a half-brother to a number of winners most notably the Group 2-placed Orpen Grey. Slowly away and green from the gates, he closed in the style of a decent type who should benefit plenty for this.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Mighty Zip</b>, who disappointed when sent off favourite on his sole start as a juvenile, looked in need of the experience when asked for his effort. He is bred to be a bit better than this and should improve over further.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Sacred Bond</b> showed some ability in two starts as a 2yo and shaped well enough on this return from a break. She is now qualified for a mark.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Acom</b>, a brother to the smart multiple-sprint winner Judd Street, kept on for pressure late which should give connections hope for the future. [Matt Boyle]<br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>A weak handicap run at a fair pace. It paid to race handy.<br /><br /> <b class="black">LAZY SIOUX</b> showed bright pace to lead from her outside draw and kept finding for pressure to win for the first time at the 22nd attempt. The refitted visor looks to have sharpened her up although this took little winning.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Qatar Princess</b>, down to a 0-50 for the first time, travelled well into the race and showed a bit more than recent starts but lacked the winner&acute;s kick turning for home and could not reel her in.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Bond Blade</b> did best of those coming from off the pace having come widest into the straight. He is running into a bit of form and would be of interest back up to 6f.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Lizzy&acute;s Dream</b>, down in trip on this second start after a break, faded late after looking to close 1f out. He&acute;s down to a handy mark but without a win since September 2012.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Master Of Disguise</b> could not take advantage of his falling mark and is proving difficult to win with.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Forceful Beacon</b>, who finished runner-up off this mark over C&D on his penultimate start, was well backed but dropped out tamely having looked dangerous 2f out. The stewards noted the trainer&acute;s representative could offer no explanation for the gelding&acute;s performance.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Fleeting Indian</b> was reported to have bled from the nose. [Matt Boyle]<br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>The principals dominated from the home turn in this modest novice hurdle.<br /><br /> <b class="black">DOUBLE SHUFFLE</b> ran out a game winner and made it 2-3 under rules. He got a tactically astute ride, taken wide as possible on the far side, and saw it out bravely from the second-last. He&acute;ll get further and could be very useful over fences down the line.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Remiluc</b> was back down in trip and faced an easier task, for which he was well backed. He held every chance and, while the headwind may not have helped his cause, time could tell he bumped into one.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Red Devil Star</b> gave his all and ought to find an opportunity before the end of the season. A step up in trip should suit him over hurdles.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Alphabet Bay</b> tried to rally after getting markedly outpaced, but it was game over from the third-last. His bumper win came on good to firm and it&acute;ll be interesting to see how the handicapper rates him.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Elkstone</b>, on his hurdling debut, caught the eye turning into the home straight and is one to keep tabs on. He too should get further.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Royal Classic</b> gave himself little chance of getting home as he refused to settle. [David Orton]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> <b class="black">Double Shuffle</b> is a chaser for next season; that&acute;s when he&acute;ll come into his own - Tom George, trainer. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>This interesting handicap proved testing in the home straight due to the strong headwind and it served up a slow-motion finish.<br /><br /> <b class="black">PHONE HOME</b>, in a second-time visor, rallied bravely and gained his reward on the run-in, doubling his career tally. He&acute;d rather lost his way since going close over further here in November and his proven stamina counted for a lot this time. It should rate a personal-best.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Morning Reggie</b> hacked up at Warwick eight days earlier and was 1lb ahead of the handicapper. It seemed as though he would follow up nearing three out when making his move. However, he ran down the next and could offer no more from the last. The headwind didn&acute;t help and he has time on his side, but life will be tougher now.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Westward Point</b>, easy to back, did his best when held from the fourh-last and it puts him back on track. The best of him may still be to come.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Trickaway</b> ran a puzzling race, rallying having looked sure to be tailed off out of the back straight. He&acute;s not straightforward, although could be worth a go over further.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Gone Too Far</b> continues to be hampered by mistakes in this sphere.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Owen Na View</b> bolted up here at the weekend and had 7lb in hand of the handicapper. The 7yo never looked happy on this easier going and is probably going to prove tricky to place in the short term. The Veterinary Officer reported that the gelding had lost a left fore shoe and sustained a cut to its leg. [David Orton]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> I think the key to <b class="black">Phone Home</b> is a flat track and this trip - Nick Mitchell, trainer. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>A fair handicap, run at a crawling early gallop with no confirmed front-runner in attendance. The going on the Hurdle course was changed to good to soft, soft in places after the first.<br /><br /> <b class="black">KATGARY</b> finally opened his account for connections and is a little better than the bare margin. Switching to more positive tactics in first-time cheekpieces made the difference, and he outclassed his rivals when extending from two out, before tiring on the run-in. This surface was as slow as he wants it and he could well have more to offer before going back over fences next season.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Carry On Sydney</b> had stamina to prove over this extra distance. The 5yo definitely improved for it, however, finishing a clear second-best, and he deserves to win again.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Flying Eagle</b> did his best work towards the finish and could be getting his act together again now his yard is in better form.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Chosen Well</b> failed to see it out, somewhat surprisingly considering he won over further at Exeter last time out. On this evidence, he&acute;s kicked off in handicaps on a tricky mark.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Ugolin De Beaumont</b> got badly outpaced on this handicap debut, but it&acute;s still early days for him and he&acute;s a staying chaser in the making. The Veterinary Officer reported that the gelding had finished lame.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Cadoudoff</b> found little and ran miles below market expectations.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Megalypos</b> was pulled up after being extremely tired in the closing stages. The Veterinary Officer reported that a post-race examination of the gelding failed to reveal any abnormalities, other than that it had sustained a cut to its mouth when stumbling and hitting its head after pulling up. [David Orton]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> <b class="black">Katgary</b> is the type who is likely to keep improving when he goes over fences - Paul Nicholls, trainer. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>Four of the declared runners came out and the two market leaders dominated.<br /><br /> <b class="black">MIDNIGHT SILVER</b> had easily won a 2m2f heavy-ground bumper at Fontwell and that extra stamina was needed in order for her to defy the penalty here, doing well to hold on after it looked as though the favourite would get the better of her against the rail. She&acute;s a nice hurdling prospect.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Kilcullen Flem</b>, bought for 24,000GBP after winning an Irish point in November, couldn&acute;t quite get back past the determined mare but it was a nice start and he looks capable of landing one of these before going hurdling.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Dothraki Raider</b> stopped to nothing, but showed definite promise and better ground may help.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Clover Park</b> was unable to step up on his debut effort, which came over C&D in the same ground. [Mark Brown]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> It was hard work, but <b class="black">Midnight Silver</b> was still galloping. She wanted to win. It was heavy but it suited her because she lacks a little bit of pace. When she goes over further and over hurdles she&acute;ll improve again - Micheal Nolan, rider. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>A weak fillies&acute; handicap run at a steady pace.<br /><br /> <b class="black">SONNETATION</b> travelled smoothly into the contest and needed no second invitations when a gap appeared up the inside rail turning for home. She was never in much danger after to win for the first time over this far. She has proved a consistent performer for connections and was scoring off a career-high mark.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Queen Of Skies</b>, back up in trip on this Tapeta debut, kept on well enough for pressure and saw the longer trip out fine but is yet to win away from the Fibresand<br /><br /> <b class="black">Apache Glory</b> did not look to have much in hand off this mark. She kept on at the one pace having moved well enough in rear.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Atlantic Affair</b> could not take advantage of this career-low mark and proved a shade disappointing. She had her own way out in front, if a touch keen, but found little for pressure on her Tapeta debut. [Matt Boyle]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> <b class="black">Sonnetation</b> deserved that win as she&acute;s been running well and is a genuine mare. She&acute;s going to be covered by Toronado next week but we may race her in foal - Jim Boyle, trainer. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>A quick pace for this decent 3yo sprint handicap.<br /><br /> <b class="black">GEORGE BOWEN</b>, making his AW debut off a career-high mark, kept on best towards the far rail to move ahead close to the line. He has come back better than ever on this return from a break and looks the type to improve over further.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Wanting</b>, raised 6lb for winning at Kempton on her previous start, travelled best into the straight and looked sure to win 1f out but she began to tire late and was caught near the post. She is still learning and can progress from this.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Enlace</b>, 2lb ahead of the handicapper having run well over 7f at Kempton, was perfectly placed to attack turning for home but was outpaced inside the final furlong. A step back up in trip could pay dividends.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Lightscameraction</b>, up in trip, was prominently ridden and saw the longer trip out fine against some fair types.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Squats</b> failed to settle on this return to handicap company and was on the back foot after.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Belvoir Diva</b>, making her handicap debut, could never get competitive and looked in need of this.<br /><br /> <b class="black">State Of The Union</b> looked to face a tough task but it was a shade disappointing how easily he was brushed aside having led into the straight. [Matt Boyle]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> I was never really going on <b class="black">George Bowen</b> but they were racing from a long way out and he came home well. He should stay 7f -Tony Hamilton, rider. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>This proved eventful and it was another attritional event due to a sound gallop and the strong headwind after turning for home.<br /><br /> <b class="black">TOTHEMOONANDBACK</b> pulled clear once taking it up in the home straight and was able to ease down at the finish. He was the proven stayer in attendance and returning to softer ground was up his street. It remains to be seen how the handicapper reacts.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Hellorboston</b> was beaten after a mistake on the final circuit. He kept to his task in the home straight.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Red Admirable</b> went well for a long way yet paid for his early exertions and found it too demanding on this quick reappearance.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Westaway</b> had yet to be asked a serious question prior to crashing out.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Rocky Bender</b>, despite having taken a keen hold, would have probably finished second had he not met the third-last all wrong. [David Orton]<br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>A modest mares&acute; handicap. Most kept wide on the far side and it saw another slow-motion finish.<br /><br /> <b class="black">EBONY EMPRESS</b> tanked into contention and proved game when under serious pressure after the last. It was her third win over hurdles and there may well be some more to come back on better going if kept on the go.<br /><br /> <b class="black">My Legal Lady</b> kept solo to the inside, cutting every corner, and threw down a gutsy challenge to the winner. It rates a sterling return from her layoff, with a first-time tongue-tie added to her visor.<br /><br /> <b class="black">What A Jewel</b> got well backed ahead of her handicap debut and wasn&acute;t disgraced considering she could have done without the overnight rain. Her turn is probably nearing.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Gaye Memories</b> should come on plenty from this return to action and is another best on a sounder surface.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Truckers Darling</b> stays further and returned to form, having arrived looking well out of sorts.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Rhythm Star</b>, equipped with first-time cheekpieces for this handicap debut, dropped out tamely once push really came to shove, having jumped to her left most of the way. It&acute;s back to the drawing board with her. [David Orton]<br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>The rails were moved to give fresh lines meaning the Hurdle course was 52yds longer per circuit and the Chase course was 40yds longer per circuit. It was evident 3mm of overnight rain had got into the already watered ground throughout the opener.Paddock inspection suggested it was an above-average novice event for this time of year and the principals came well clear. It was a proper test with the strong headwind in the home straight.<br /><br /> <b class="black">MIGHT BITE</b> got bogged down in a heavy-ground bumper when fancied to make a winning debut here in February but he made amends in decent fashion on this switch to hurdling. He went enthusiastically and ate up the longer distance, not surprisingly as he&acute;s by Scorpion and a half-brother to Beat That. His jumping should improve for the experience and he rates a very useful stayer in the making, with fences sure to be on his agenda in due course.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Royalraise</b> had experience on his side yet didn&acute;t totally convince with his early hurdling. The 6yo kept stoutly to his task without ever threatening and got the longer trip well. It was his best effort yet and he should find an opening this term.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Mr Dinosaur</b> easily won an ordinary 2m4f point for Tom Lacey last April and, with a tongue-tie enlisted, was fancied for his hurdling debut for new connections. He paid for doing the donkey work, but it was a promising display and he should come on plenty. Paul Nicholls blamed himself afterwards for running on such easy ground, as he apparently definitely wants a sounder surface. The representative of the trainer reported that the gelding had a breathing problem.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Sadler&acute;s Gold</b>, a flop at 2-5 in a Plumpton bumper on debut in November, went well under a handy ride on this introduction to hurdles. The longer trip in such conditions proved far too demanding, though. [David Orton]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> <b class="black">Might Bite</b> will not be hanging around over hurdles because he&acute;s a chaser, and that&acute;s why we didn&acute;t mind running in a novice hurdle at this stage of the season - Nicky Henderson, trainer. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>Plenty of pace for this modest handicap.<br /><br /> <b class="black">PATRON OF EXPLORES</b>, who lacked the speed over shorter here three days earlier, appreciated the step up in trip to move ahead close to the line and win for the first time at the 14th attempt. This is not strong form but these look to be his conditions.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Pipers Piping</b> had dropped to a tempting mark and likes it here. He ran much better than in recent starts and was only caught late on. He&acute;s one to keep on side in the coming weeks.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Rezwaan</b>, 4lb ahead of the handicapper despite carrying a 6lb penalty for bolting up at Kempton eight days earlier, cantered through the contest but found less than expected off the bit. He&acute;s done most of his winning at Kempton.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Galilee Chapel</b> appreciated the switch to these more prominent tactics and was only run out of it late on.<br /><br /> <b class="black">One Last Dream</b>, back down in trip, again gave his running but is not proving easy to win with.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Look Here&acute;s Al</b> came to challenge nearest the inside rail before his effort flattened out close home. [Matt Boyle]<br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>Half of the field failed to complete in this modest hunter chase.<br /><br /> <b class="black">CATSPAN</b>, recent winner of a point-to-point, had his stamina put to good use but he got very tired late on nearly gave it away. This was a first chase win under rules.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Sweet Like You</b>, another recently successful in the pointing field, kept on well again having dropped off the winner and was good value for second. She can pick up one of these.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Loch Ard</b> had been off since falling in a point 11 months earlier and that lack of a recent run told late on. He&acute;s entitled to strip fitter.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Patricktom Boru</b> reappeared with a win in a point recently but couldn&acute;t carry the form back over to racing under rules. [Mark Brown]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> <b class="black">Catspan</b> scrambled over the last. He went on the ground, but I&acute;m not sure any horse likes it like that. It&acute;s horrendous - Hannah Lewis, rider. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>Rain overnight turned the ground extremely testing, with David Bass saying it was "as heavy as I&acute;ve ever ridden on". The runners were going up and down on the spot for much of the last two furlongs of this maiden hurdle.<br /><br /> <b class="black">THEDRINKYMEISTER</b> set the standard on form, had run well on heavy ground in the past and never looked in much danger of being passed. He&acute;ll be a staying chaser next season.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Berea Venture</b> had run well at the course on debut and bounced back from a disappointing run on similar ground to this at Exeter, plugging on despite looking out on his feet. He too is a staying chaser in the making.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Veripek</b> was unable to build on his hurdles debut, being eased off late on once his rider knew his winning chance was over. It&acute;s probable this ground was too testing and he is worth of another chance. [Mark Brown]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> I knew he&acute;d stay on. <b class="black">Thedrinkymeister</b> is going to be a nice staying chaser in the mud - David Bass, rider. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>A decent little handicap that saw a dour display of galloping from the winner.<br /><br /> <b class="black">FLINTHAM</b>, well beaten in a Grade 2 at Warwick last time, had earlier been most progressive in handicaps and, although 15lb higher than when last scoring, he was able to run out an authoritative winner. Related to Carruthers and Coneygree, it&acute;s safe to say chasing is going to be his game.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Themanfrom Minella</b> continues to run well from this mark, getting it going all too late here though to take second. He continues to shape as though worth another try at 3m.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Rathlin Rose</b>, on a roll until held from this mark on her recent handicap debut over 3m at Doncaster, was down in trip, but the testing ground made it a thorough test and she failed to see it out.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Hansupfordetroit</b> looked in position to go close off the final bend, but he slowly faded.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Aigle De La See</b>, progressive until a beaten favourite when only seventh in the EBF Final at Sandown, was unable to get himself back on track in this easier race and has probably had enough for the season now. Chasing will be his game. [Mark Brown]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> Chasing is his game.

He clearly thrives in these conditions.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Cruising Bye</b> was finishing runner-up for the sixth time in his last eight starts, getting it going all too late. He&acute;d have finished even further clear of the third but for a bad blunder two out.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Accordingtopalm</b> was never close enough to challenge and remains a maiden over fences under rules.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Shattered Dream</b> continues to run poorly, the cheekpieces failing to make a difference. [Mark Brown]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> <b class="black">Red Devil Lads</b> does love that ground and when he&acute;s galloping like that in it it&acute;s hard for the others - Rebecca Curtis, trainer. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>The first two came clear in this modest event.<br /><br /> <b class="black">SIREN&acute;S COVE</b> had shaped as though worth a try over a longer trip, and it certainly brought about the improvement expected as she travelled well off the pace before quickening up down the outside in the straight. There should be more to come from her over middle distances and she&acute;s one to keep on side.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Leoncavallo</b>, whose dam stayed 1m4f, was also stepping up in trip, and like the winner he too improved for it. He was kept wide most of the way, which meant he travelled further than ideal, but at least he was out of the kickback. He and the winner pulled nicely clear of the rest and he should be able to win a similar race.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Duke Street</b> found the weakening leader falling back into his path turning in and was denied a clear run, but he rallied well in the closing stages. His pedigree is chock full of stamina and the further he goes the better.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Goolagong Girl</b> was first to kick for home off the turn, but she couldn&acute;t hold off some better treated, less-exposed rivals.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Retro Valley</b> didn&acute;t improve for the step up in trip.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Vivo Per Lei</b> looked interesting up in trip and made the running, but she weakened quickly off the turn and perhaps not all was well. [Steffan Edwards]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> The step up in trip has helped <b class="black">Siren&acute;s Cove</b> and James Tate has his horses in fine form just now. They went an even gallop which allowed me to pick them up inside the last furlong - David Probert, jockey. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>A competitive sprint but once again the leader proved hard to peg back.<br /><br /> <b class="black">BERTIE BLU BOY</b> missed the kick slightly and had to be niggled along to get to the front, but he then responded to pressure from some way out and kept rolling up the straight. This was only his second start over 6f and he proved he can be effective over it, especially on a track like this where racing up with the pace is an advantage.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Spitfire</b>, back from a break, stayed on well from off the pace but again he came up a bit short.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Invigilator</b> had a good pace to chase down and came to have every chance, but he just couldn&acute;t get by the winner. It was another solid run, though.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Gung Ho Jack</b>, now 15lb higher than when he won here at the beginning of last month, threatened to get into contention when nipping through on the inside turning in, but his effort soon flattened out. The handicapper might just have him now.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Harwoods Star</b>, 5lb well in, was out the back facing a load of kickback for much of the race.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Amenable</b> couldn&acute;t dominate. [Steffan Edwards]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> <b class="black">Bertie Blu Boy</b> likes to be on the pace and the drop in trip has suited him well - Kevin Lundie, jockey. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>There was little competition for the lead and as a result the pace was pretty steady early on.<br /><br /> <b class="black">BINT DANDY</b> didn&acute;t have to go that fast in front and had plenty left in the locker to fight off her challengers in the straight. She clearly handles this surface better than many, but hopefully she can translate her improvement back to turf this upcoming season.<br /><br /> <b class="black">First Experience</b> was always the winner&acute;s closest pursuer and, in a race in which few got involved, was better placed than many to throw down a challenge. She hadn&acute;t tried this surface before but she put up another sound effort in defeat.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Subtle Knife</b> wasn&acute;t ideally placed in a race lacking pace and it was always going to be difficult trying to close on quickening leaders.<br /><br /> <b class="black">India&acute;s Song</b>, who has won over 1m2f here, wasn&acute;t suited by the lack of a gallop over this shorter trip.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Compton Bird</b>, making her seasonal reappearance is another who has form over further. She was also unsuited by the way the race was run. [Steffan Edwards]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> <b class="black">Bint Dandy</b> did it nicely from the front and seems to like the surface here - Silvestre de Sousa, jockey. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>An ordinary handicap.<br /><br /> <b class="black">MISHRIF</b>, whose last outing came on the ice at St Moritz, was back on a more realistic mark and running over his best trip, and he battled on well to score.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Claude Greenwood</b> showed the speed to race among the leaders and eventually did best of the three who pressed the pace. He benefited from being out of the kickback, but he was backing up a good run at Kempton as is obviously in decent form.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Great Expectations</b> stayed on from last to take third but could never throw down a serious challenge to the first two. His style of running isn&acute;t ideally suited to the way this track is currently riding.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Club House</b> enjoyed a ground-saving trip but couldn&acute;t pick up in the closing stages. This surface might not be for him.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Loud</b>, back up in trip for a new stable, pressed the leaders but was always widest of all.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Nifty Kier</b>, down in distance, bagged the lead but couldn&acute;t make the most of it.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Hierarch</b> was disappointing and perhaps he didn&acute;t handle the surface. [Steffan Edwards]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> The surface is a bit different but <b class="black">Mishrif</b> was game in the finish and it&acute;s great that my first ride here is a winner - Charlie Bennett, jockey. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>Far from plain sailing for the odds-on favourite.<br /><br /> <b class="black">ENTERTAINMENT</b> was sent off a short price to get off the mark at the third attempt, and while she did win she was hardly impressive. She was keen early, showed signs of greenness approaching the 4f marker and again in the closing stages and in the end did just enough. Improvement will be required if she&acute;s to make her mark in handicaps.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Strong Steps</b>, a half-brother to four winners including Inyordreams (6f-6.5f inc 2yo/Listed; RPR 105) and Fire Eyes (Listed-placed 5f 2yo; )101), shaped with promise and almost made a winning debut. He should be able to find an opening in due course.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Harlestone Hopes</b> again ran well and will be interesting when he eventually steps up in trip in handicaps.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Pyla</b> ran her best race to date and can now go handicapping.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Silver Secret</b> raced in rear and got a face full of kickback before making some late headway once switched to the outer in the straight. There&acute;s ability there and he might be one to bear in mind for handicaps down the road.<br /><br /> <b class="black">One Man Army</b> faced his share of kickback on his debut. [Steffan Edwards]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> <b class="black">Entertainment</b> was looking at everything all the way around and she ran about in the straight. She&acute;d only done a couple of bits of work and will be better over a mile and a quarter with cut in the ground - Rab Havlin, jockey. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>An open race despite the small field.<br /><br /> <b class="black">YUL FINEGOLD</b>, bought out of a Wolverhampton seller a week ago, made a winning debut for his new yard. He trailed the field by a fair margin in the early stages and was being niggled along down the back straight, but he steadily made up his ground and was nicely on top at the finish. He&acute;s appeared to appreciate give in the ground on turf in the past, so a wet spring could help.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Tight Lipped</b>, blinkered for the first time, held a good position next to the leader for most of the race and had his chance from the turn in, but the winner, who came from further back, saw the trip out stronger. His strike-rate isn&acute;t the greatest.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Cherry Street</b> again pulled for his head early on and, while he plugged on in the closing stages, he had less left in the tank than would have been the case had he settled better.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Footstepsintherain</b> was up in distance and didn&acute;t see it out as well as some.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Le Deluge</b> didn&acute;t help his cause by galloping a circuit before the start.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Hanno</b> made the running but was seen off early in the straight. He proved costly to follow last year and continued where he left off. [Steffan Edwards]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> They went hard early and <b class="black">Yul Finegold</b> couldn&acute;t go with them. I gave him a smack turning in and that woke him up and he ran on well. Conor wanted me to get him off 13 winners and I have done - Hayley Turner, jockey. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>Modest form but it was a nice effort by the winner.<br /><br /> <b class="black">GOLDEN MILAN</b> &acute;s best run in novice events came over this C&D and he showed much-improved form on this handicap debut, cruising to the front and keeping on well towards the stands&acute; rail without his rider having to get at all serious. He&acute;s looks a decent staying chase prospect.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Tambura</b>, up 9lb after scoring by 15l at Uttoxeter, couldn&acute;t match the progressive winner, but saw her race out well and remains capable from this sort of mark.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Belmount</b>, penalised for his recent Warwick win, was simply asked to make up too much ground in the straight, especially when considering the going was so testing. He was running on strongly at the line and we&acute;ve still to see the best of him. Chasing will be his game.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Jaunty Inflight</b> didn&acute;t see this longer trip out, but only faded from the last. He may last home on better ground.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Gilzean</b>, up 5lb, had won two of his last three, including in this sort of ground, so this has to go down as a disappointment. [Mark Brown]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> I think <b class="black">Golden Milan</b> will jump fences. He was impressive and we didn&acute;t expect him to handle the ground as well as he did there - Paul Townend, rider. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>A race everybody had their eye on with a newcomer to the Willie Mullins stable running off a mark of 80. He just prevailed.<br /><br /> <b class="black">ROUMANIAN</b> had shown nothing in a handful of starts for another yard, but that didn&acute;t mean he wouldn&acute;t show significant improvement on his first start for the champion trainer. He just about did. He travelled like a good horse for most of the journey and came there like a good horse to win his race, but in the end he was really put to the pin of his collar by the runner-up and there didn&acute;t appear to be much more in the tank. Perhaps he&acute;ll show more on better round but this would suggest that he might struggle to win under a penalty.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Cloudy Morning</b> was settled off the pace and made up his ground gradually. He had every chance when getting there at the second-last and to his credit he really put it up to the winner from the final flight. He was beaten on the nod. This is his grade.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Manibus</b> doesn&acute;t have much handicap experience but this might suggest he&acute;s a potential improver. He made up his ground quite nicely and travelled as well as anything turning into the straight but in the end his run just flattened out a bit. He was one-paced in the end but there may well be a fair bit more to come.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Notification</b> was a bit one-paced from the third last having been close enough to have a chance turning out of the back straight but ran a fair race.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Callhimpaddy</b> was another to run quite a nice race and there could be a bit more to come from him on better ground. He had a slight advantage early in the straight but his effort started to run out of steam before a blunder at the third-last. [Justin O&acute;Hanlon]<br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>The rain came at exactly the right time for this winner, who is certainly a mudlark but he&acute;s not bad either.<br /><br /> <b class="black">CAPTAINOFTHEFLEET</b> just about got home in front with the testing ground and the rider&acute;s 7lb claim proving crucial. Racing just off the middling pace for most of the journey, his rider bided his time in making his challenge, but a good jump saw him lead at the second-last and from there his stamina came into play. He travelled well throughout this race. not something he always does, but he really dug deep as well. If he got soft ground at Punchestown he would be a big player in a race like their valuable 3m handicap hurdle.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Your Busy</b> galloped strongly the whole way, was probably a little bit keen, but Ruby Walsh kept him to the outer for whatever better ground there was and it nearly paid off. The winner&acute;s preference for the ground proved the difference, but this is a good ground horse and it did seem to show that the ground on the outer may have been significantly better.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Kylecrue</b> also raced wide and Danny Mullins gradually wound him up to challenge. He ran on well from the last but just wasn&acute;t quite good enough. It was a very encouraging effort for all that.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Railway Tommy</b> was patiently ridden more towards the inner and did come there with every chance in the straight but in the end his effort petered out a bit disappointingly.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Tiger Bay Lady</b> is becoming a disappointing mare and her effort early in the straight was a very short-lived one. [Justin O&acute;Hanlon]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> He loves this ground, but he&acute;s a good horse. We like to space his runs out a bit but if it came up soft at Punchestown we&acute;ll run. If not, we&acute;ll wind it up for the season - Eamonn O&acute;Connell, trainer of <b class="black">Captainofthefleet</b>. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>An ordinary enough bumper but the winner had shown plenty of promise in a Limerick bumper on debut and fulfilled it here.<br /><br /> <b class="black">MALL DINI</b> is a fine big chasing type and probably not that suited to bumpers but he managed to land this. He always raced close to the pace and perhaps his rider didn&acute;t have any real choice but to go to the front when she did before the straight. She still managed to hold onto something though and the horse responded well to go a few lengths clear inside the quarter mile and then found enough to repel the two challenges which emerged. He&acute;s probably a good horse, but the best of him is highly unlikely to be seen until he jumps hurdles and eventually fences.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Dallas Cowboy</b> has some reasonable form to his credit but at this stage he doesn&acute;t look to be a star in the making. On saying that, he&acute;s another that will improve when he goes hurdling. He raced close to the pace and he battled on well when he had to inside the last furlong or so but the winner was just too good. It&acute;s looking that bit more unlikely that this horse will win a bumper.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Waterville Rock</b> ran a nice race on debut and there should be a fair bit more to come from him. He gradually improved his position from mid-division and came there with every chance in the straight but his relative lack of experience came into play late in the day. There was plenty to like about it though and it would be very surprising if there wasn&acute;t further improvement.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Thekingofrocknroll</b> came under pressure to hold his place before the straight and early in the straight but he kept going and it would have to be considered a satisfactory debut. He&acute;ll improve. The remainder were in the next parish. [Justin O&acute;Hanlon]<br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>Well over half the field pulled up on the testing ground but the winner did it impressively and according to his trainer wasn&acute;t winning out of turn.<br /><br /> <b class="black">KING BLUE</b> was quite patiently ridden by Katie Walsh who edged him closer in the back straight and was content to bide her time before sending him on. In the end she pushed the button before the second-last and he wasn&acute;t long about pulling clear. He could even afford to run around a little on the testing ground coming to the final flight but he jumped it well and in the end couldn&acute;t have won much more easily. Racing today off the same mark as when a close second to Mydor at Fairyhouse, it didn&acute;t take much of a leap of faith to see him winning a race like this and he should be able to mix it in better company on this sort of ground.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Dactik</b> hasn&acute;t done anything for a while, but with the stable having a winner at Thurles the previous week, this fellow might not be far off winning either. He raced quite handily, and while he had no chance with the winner in the straight, he kept on to very good effect.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Miss Peacetime</b> could well be a gradually progressive sort. She was never that far from the pace but she stayed in there quite deep into the race before being found to be a bit one-paced. There was nothing wrong with this effort and she should continue to improve.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Colms Dream</b> was ridden close to the pace and appeared to race a bit keenly. Indeed it looked as though he would drop right away under pressure when he was headed before the straight but he did manage to keep on to reasonable effect.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Bye Bye O Bye</b> travelled well into the race as they turned out of the back straight but ultimately he didn&acute;t get home. It was a fair effort though. [Justin O&acute;Hanlon]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> He ran terribly flat at Thurles last time but we freshened him up since and he did here what we thought he would do at Thurles. There might be a race at Fairyhouse for him - Ross O&acute;Sullivan, trainer of <b class="black">King Blue</b>. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>The testing state of the ground was painfully evident as most of these were out with the washing some way out, but the winner only just lasted it out.<br /><br /> <b class="black">ONE COOL PRINCESS</b> made all, initially at a steady pace but gradually increased the tempo until the point was reached early in the straight where her advantage seemed unassailable. In the end she only just hung on but she was out on her own for a long time and was entitled to get a bit weary. She handled this ground well enough but her pedigree suggests she&acute;ll handle better ground. Time will tell.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Cairde Aris</b> was held up initially and moved into second place as they turned out of the back straight. Her rider didn&acute;t really get after her until between the final two flights when the winner was only showing small signs of coming back. Who knows what might have happened had he got after her a bit earlier, she might not have come home as well as she did, and as it was she was probably a little flattered by her proximity to the winner.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Hawkers Son</b> led the rest of them home but he had no chance from about the fourth-last. They were strung out like Wednesday&acute;s washing behind the first two home. [Justin O&acute;Hanlon]<br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>The winner benefited from getting the allowances, a canny front-running ride and probably the step up in trip.<br /><br /> <b class="black">THUNDER ZONE</b> showed no ill effect from his Cheltenham exertions. Making all at a steady pace, his rider used the opportunity perfectly and gave him a good breather at about the top of the straight and he responded well when challenged. He really ploughed through the testing ground. His jumping still doesn&acute;t impress at times but this should open up more options for him.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Sadler&acute;s Risk</b> was ridden handily by Andrew Lynch, who bided his time and produced what looked like a winning challenge at the second-last, but when the winner found a bit more he had no answer. It was a flat effort on ground deep enough for him and he wasn&acute;t knocked about when his chance had gone. That should stand him in good stead with Punchestown in mind.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Aklan</b> was given every chance by Ruby Walsh but his heart doesn&acute;t look to be in it. The rider could get little or no response from him when he asked. [Justin O&acute;Hanlon]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> It didn&acute;t work out for him at Cheltenham, he might as well have stayed at home. The step up in trip and the soft ground suited him. He&acute;ll be entered up until the ground dries out - Gordon Elliott, trainer of <b class="black">Thunder Zone</b>. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>Hard to know what sort of race this was as they went a very steady pace on very testing ground, but there was plenty to like about the winner&acute;s performance.<br /><br /> <b class="black">SIZING KILLARNEY</b> was giving lumps of weight away to most of these on his debut but he&acute;s a really imposing individual who proved well up to the task. He sat close to the muddling pace, jumped well throughout, but when faced with a significant challenge from the runner-up from the second-last his jumping had to be accurate and he outjumped the more experienced runner-up. As the trainer stated afterwards, winning a maiden hurdle first time out at this stage of the season is hardly ideal, but his future is not over hurdles. He is a nice recruit and looks certain to get further.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Crystal Pearl</b> went close again and appeared to have no excuses. Racing close to the pace, she moved through to challenge the winner from the second-last but her jumping didn&acute;t stand up to the pressure. She should win a maiden hurdle and might be more suited to better ground.<br /><br /> <b class="black">On The Dry</b> is a nice horse and built on a nice debut run at Gowran. He made progress to chase the leaders to the second-last but he still showed plenty of greenness and possibly got stuck in the mud a little. He could well be good enough to win a summer maiden hurdle if that route is explored.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Comedy Club</b> didn&acute;t do badly as he kept on at one pace having raced handily on the inner most of the way. He looks sure to find more improvement on better ground.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Alchimix</b> raced close to the head of the muddling pace the whole way, but ultimately was onepaced. It&acute;s likely he needs a trip. [Justin O&acute;Hanlon]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> He&acute;s a real chaser and an exciting horse, we think he&acute;s a three-miler. He handled that ground well and we might put him in a winners-of-one over this trip on soft ground - Henry de Bromhead, trainer of <b class="black">Sizing Killarney</b>. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>A fair fillies&acute; handicap run at a steady pace.<br /><br /> <b class="black">VERUS DELICIA</b>, making her Tapeta/seasonal debut, had struggled in four previous AW starts but she stayed on best nearest the far rail under a strong ride. She was well handicapped judged on her turf form and did this well enough.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Fab Lolly</b>, dropping in trip and grade, seemed to be going best 1f out but found less than the winner close to the line. All four career successes have come over 7f.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Poetic Choice</b>, in the first-time cheekpieces, came under pressure some way out and could not take advantage of her falling mark.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Chookie&acute;s Lass</b> bounced back to form when runner-up at Chelmsford when last seen and remained on a handy mark. She had her own way in front but dropped out rather tamely and is not the most consistent.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Sakhee&acute;s Rose</b>, 5lb higher than when scoring over 7f here in January, was looking to close when short of room and taking a false step 1f out from which she could not recover.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Moiety</b> got upset in the stalls and had to be withdrawn. [Matt Boyle]<br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>The pace was sound for this uncompetitive maiden.<br /><br /> <b class="black">SAMMY&acute;S WARRIOR</b>, who showed signs of ability in a 7f maiden here on his sole start as a juvenile, stepped up on that effort to get off the mark at the second attempt. The step up in trip looks to have suited and he was in control close to the line. There should be more to come.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Amaze Me</b> set a fair standard judged on her debut fourth in a Newbury maiden. She ran a decent race from the front but was outstayed near the line. A mark of 85 looks harsh enough although she should improve for this.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Goodby Inheritence</b>, who showed little in two 1m Kempton maidens in 2014, was well supported but ruined his chance by failing to settle early. Having travelled smoothly into the race he paid for his earlier exertions and found little off the bit. He looks to have some ability.<br /><br /> <b class="black">On A Whim</b>, a 27,000 guineas half-sister to GB/Qatar 6f-1m winner Limit Up (including AW), was very slowly away and looked in need of this but was getting the hang of things late.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Art Looker</b>, whose Dam is a half-sister to Oaks winner Look Here and multiple 7f-1m4f (mainly AW) winner Daniel Thomas, came under pressure some way out and looks one for the future. [Matt Boyle]<br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>They went a decent pace for this open handicap.<br /><br /> <b class="black">GOLD CLUB</b>, just 2lb higher than when all out to score over 6f at Kempton earlier in the month, cantered through the contest and needed no second invitation when a gap appeared up the far rail turning for home. He saw the longer trip out fine and should remain fairly treated once reassessed.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Pearl Ransom</b>, who failed to shine on his Fibresand debut when last seen, appreciated this switch back to the Tapeta but could not get close to challenge. He&acute;s a likable type but 4lb above his last success.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Wickhambrook</b>, gelded since his last run and making his debut for connections, was down to a 0-70 for the first time. He closed well late and looks on a fair mark.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Ortac Rock</b> was unable to lead but kept on well enough for pressure up the straight.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Hoy Hoy</b> faced a tough looking task on this handicap debut but ran with some promise on his first Flat start for this yard.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Mambo Spirit</b> raced keen and wide early so ran well enough in the circumstances. His rider reported that the gelding ran too free.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Bond Empire</b> was well supported but readily brushed aside on this handicap debut. [Matt Boyle]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> <b class="black">Gold Club</b> won over six at Kempton last time but I thought this extra furlong would help him. Hopefully the handicapper will not be harsh and then I can get him in another 0-70 - Ed McMahon, trainer. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>A competitive contest for the grade run at a strong pace. The front two finished a long way clear.<br /><br /> <b class="black">CANON LAW</b>, on this debut for connections, bounced back to form under a strong ride to reel in the leader close to the line and win for the first time on the AW. He had failed to shine over a wide variety of trips in Ireland but looked suited by this strongly run extended 1m1f.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Tizlove Regardless</b> was sharpened up by the first-blinkers and quickly built up a commanding lead but having looked sure to win turning for home could not hold off the late challenge of the runner-up. Compensation should not be far away.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Fantasy Gladiator</b> could not take advantage of this drop to a 0-70 for the first time since September 2013 but saw the longer trip out well having been in rear turning for home.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Water Dancer</b>, stepping up in trip on this handicap debut, travelled widest into the straight and is worth another go at this distance.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Tight Lipped</b> again failed to shine and will be of more interest back on the turf. [Matt Boyle]<br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>An ordinary seller run at a sound pace.<br /><br /> <b class="black">AL MUHEER</b> appreciated the step back up in trip on this return to a seller to run out an easy winner. He quickened smartly turning for home and despite hanging across the track inside the final furlong was not for catching. He looks a fair performer in this grade.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Manipulation</b> made a fairly encouraging return from a long absence in a decent handicap last month and was heavily supported here. Slowly away, he had plenty on turning for home and despite keeping on well could not reel in the winner. A longer trip may suit.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Ocean Legend</b> arrived in decent form but found this stretching him.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Prime Exhibit</b>, who was not favoured by the race conditions, kept on well enough for pressure without looking dangerous.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Takahiro</b> failed to see out this longer trip and may appreciate a switch back to low-grade handicaps. [Matt Boyle]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> I bought <b class="black">Al Muheer</b> for Paddy [Vaughan] to ride to get his career going, but he&acute;s not the easiest of rides as it turned out - Tom Dascombe, trainer. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>A fair pace for this second division of the moderate 7f handicap.<br /><br /> <b class="black">INDIAN AFFAIR</b> did well to race handy from his high draw and kept finding for pressure having been sent to the front turning for home. He had been given a chance by the handicapper and this did not come out of turn. He should continue to run well.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Indian Giver</b>, in the first-time hood off this career-low mark, ran a much improved race but could not quite get past the winner.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Bitusa</b>, with the blinkers back on replacing the eyeshield, confirmed the promise shown on his stable debut at Dundalk but remains a maiden.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Olney Lass</b> is down to a handy mark but could only keep on at the one pace up the far rail. Her losing run is growing.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Malih</b> did best of those coming from the rear. This was more promising and he is down to a tempting mark.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Distant Shadow</b> had run well off this rating over C&D on her penultimate outing but was always on the back foot after a slow start. [Matt Boyle]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> I was a little worried that this race was coming only five days after Kempton, but it looked such a good opportunity we had to run. <b class="black">Indian Affair</b> is very genuine - Milton Bradley, trainer. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>The pace was sound for this modest handicap.<br /><br /> <b class="black">HICKSTER</b> appreciated the step back up in trip to hold on bravely under an excellent ride. Always close to the pace, he was sent for home some way out and was all out to hold the fast-finishing runner-up. Connections are getting the best out of him now and his last three runs over C&D read 121.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Kindlelight Storm</b>, in the first-time visor, posted a gallant effort in his search for a fifth C&D success but the winner got first run and that proved the difference. He&acute;ll remain fairly treated.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Senor George</b> ran well but could not take advantage of this drop into a 0-60 for the first time. He travelled smoothly into the race but lacked the winner&acute;s finishing kick turning for home and could not reel him in.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Stamp Duty</b> again gave his running but bumped into some better-handicapped rivals.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Destiny Blue</b>, down to a career-low mark, finished in fine style having been in rear 2f out. This was more encouraging. [Matt Boyle]<br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>A weak staying handicap in which they were strung out early and it proved eventful.<br /><br /> <b class="black">COSWAY SPIRIT</b> landed a gamble, although was anything but enthusiastic about doing so and he got an outstanding ride from David Bass, who registered a first-ever treble. The 8yo had to be booted along from the start and proved extremely hard work for Bass. To his credit his best jump came two out and he did have plenty left after the last. It was his third course win and is well up to defying a rise around here, if the mood takes him.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Tinelyra</b> emerged looking a threat to the winner around four out. However, his sole win came over 2m here and it looked a case of stamina deserting him as the winner poured it on around the home turn.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Jolly Boys Outing</b> met the second fence wrong and it was his fencing thereafter which held him back. He probably found it coming soon enough after his previous second over C&D 11 days earlier.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Dougalstar</b> didn&acute;t look to fancy this task and remains a maiden.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Midnight Dove</b> looked as though he was about to be asked some questions prior to giving his rider no chance of staying aboard at the 11th. [David Orton]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> David Bass really suited <b class="black">Cosway Spirit</b>. Given half the chance he will pull your leg and I told David not to take it easy at any stage.

He put his previous experience to great effect as he bossed the race from a long way out under Tony McCoy and was much too good. A sound surface evidently suits.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Mr K</b> posted an improved effort on this much stiffer course and has the scope for jumping, despite being bred for the Flat.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Danvinnie</b> probably ran close to his debut third at this venue last April. He looks a stayer in the making.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Morthanalegend</b> did some fair work late in the piece and shaped as though he&acute;d come on a deal for this debut experience.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Minstrel Royal</b> is well bred, being half-brother to most notably smart staying chaser Barbers Shop, and was solid in the market. He paid for doing far too much through the early stages as he fell in a hole from 2f out.

There is no chance he will be seen over hurdles before May - Neil Mulholland, trainer. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>This ordinary handicap was run at a modest gallop and rather fell apart once it lifted from three out.<br /><br /> <b class="black">MIGHTY MAMBO</b> put his rivals to the sword when kicking on from the third-last flight and could have been called the winner jumping the next. He skipped off this ground and, despite a likely rise, will have decent claims of going in again if maintaining this sort of form.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Crouching Harry</b> found second win after the last, but the winner had gone beyond recall. Not badly treated over hurdles, this 2m Flat winner looks to want an even stiffer test when he faced here.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Dexter Benjamin</b> hit a flat spot at a crucial stage and was doing his best work late in the day. He&acute;s begun life in handicaps on a workable mark and stepping up in trip could do the trick.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Lost In Newyork</b> was another that got tapped for toe when the winner went clear, although probably wasn&acute;t far off his recent level and helps to set the standard. [David Orton]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> Racing on the Flat has given <b class="black">Mighty Mambo</b> that bit of confidence and it&acute;s nice to see him back to winning ways over jumps - Lawney Hill, trainer. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>A moderate handicap, run at a decent pace.<br /><br /> <b class="black">WATERLOO DOCK</b> had a bit to prove on this return to 7f but he stuck on gamely when hard pressed near the line to hold off the well-backed favourite. He&acute;s becoming a fairly reliable performer at this lowly level.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Sleet</b> had the blinkers back on for this Tapeta debut. Not that well away from his inside draw, he was hampered when looking to close 1f and would not go past the winner. He is proving expensive to follow.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Studfarmer</b> saw the longer trip out well enough from this mark 4lb above his sole AW success.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Patron Of Explores</b> attracted support in his search for a first career success but lacked the pace to get competitive over this shorter trip.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Little Choosey</b>, 5lb higher than when scoring over 6f here in January, was briefly short of room when looking to challenge up the far rail but did not close when the gap appeared.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Lucky Boo</b>, in the first-time blinkers, struggled to go the early pace before making modest late progress.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Mick Dundee</b>, with the blinkers refitted, was heavily supported through the morning but dropped out tamely having done plenty in front from the gates. [Matt Boyle]<br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>The two with the most obvious claims came clear of the only other finisher.<br /><br /> <b class="black">SHY JOHN</b> unseated early last time, but he&acute;d earlier been progressing well and got himself back on track, doing well considering he wasn&acute;t as fluent as the runner-up late on. He shouldn&acute;t go up much and this lightly raced 9yo remains capable of further success.<br /><br /> <b class="black">King Massini</b>, wearing first-time cheekpieces, had the run of it early and won&acute;t get many better chances than this. He battled well when challenged, but couldn&acute;t fend off the more progressive winner.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Dashing George</b> was readily dropped by the front pair.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Barton Heather</b> was by no means out of it when coming down three out and would likely have been involved in the finish. [Mark Brown]<br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>A moderate handicap. There was a fair gallop on.<br /><br /> <b class="black">WICKLEWOOD</b>, who came to grief here over further last time out, saw off the runner-up from the final fence and landed a second win of the season, his fourth at Towcester. His last win came from a 9lb lower mark in December and so this has to rate his best effort to date.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Lord Landen</b> held every chance in the home straight but was outstayed by the winner. He appreciated the sounder surface and is fairly treated at present, but a less demanding circuit suits best.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Cool Bob</b> proved hard work for his inexperienced rider and his career record now reads 0-53.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Royalracket</b> didn&acute;t appear too straightforward. On this showing, though, he may get closer back up in trip now the going is drying out.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Cabaret Girl</b>, a hurdles winner here, was in trouble jumping the second-last and has become hard to predict.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Grand Article</b>, 8lb higher back on quicker going, was beaten before stamina for this extra distance became a real issue and something looked amiss. [David Orton]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> Talk about horses for courses, <b class="black">Wicklewood</b> just loves it here. Fair play to Tom Cannon it was his idea to go round the inside and must have saved ten to 20 lengths. It was a brilliant ride - Mark Gillard, trainer. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>This uncompetitive novice hurdle is straightforward enough to rate around the penalised runner-up. The riders afterwards agreed the official going description was accurate but reported the course to be "quite inconsistent" due to watering, with the softest ground at the bottom of the home straight.<br /><br /> <b class="black">LAURIUM</b> added to his bumper win earlier this season and scored with a lot left in the tank. Dropping back to this stiffest of minimum distances promised to be the perfect test for him and he outclassed his rivals. There were still signs of greeness when he was out in front and it&acute;ll be very interesting to see what he can do in handicap company off a prospective mark in the mid-120s.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Aviator</b> had a lot more on his plate than when scoring on his hurdling debut at Fakenham and he probably achieved more in defeat. This triple Flat winner should get further back on a sharper circuit and could land a handicap this term.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Romulus Du Donjon</b>, who didn&acute;t go unbacked, rather spoilt his cause by making errors and looks more of a long-term project.<br /><br /> <b class="black">The Lion Man</b> showed a bit more on this switch to hurdles on a quicker surface. He was recruited from the Irish pointing scene (0-4) and should relish stepping up in trip, so is one to keep an eye on for low-grade handicaps in due course. [David Orton]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> <b class="black">Laurium</b> a lovely horse for next year and is progressing well. I&acute;d say he will run again this season to get some experience but he&acute;s going to be one for handicaps next season - Patrick Harty, assistant trainer. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>A weak staying handicap. The first two came well clear in a tight finish.<br /><br /> <b class="black">RIVER DANCING</b>, whose trainer won this last season, belatedly made it 13th time lucky and landed some hefty bets in the process. The step up in trip suited and he&acute;s evidently come right after a break, but he wouldn&acute;t be one to go overboard about if turning out quickly as he showed signs of temperament.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Ordensritter</b> gave himself every chance with a big leap at the final flight, although he was always just being held. The 7yo was a clear second-best, clearly got the longer trip and deserves to win one of these.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Essteepee</b> went enthusiastically from the front yet seemed to find this trip too much and reverting to a sharper test may be on the cards.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Elton Fox</b> never looked that happy as he refused to settle and his rider called it a day shortly after turning for home when well beaten. [Mark Brown]<br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>This was a modest mares&acute; handicap, run at a routine gallop and only the principals mattered from three out.<br /><br /> <b class="black">TARA TAVEY</b> once again relished this extreme finish and ran out a clear-cut winner, following up her C&D success 11 days earlier. She was up 8lb and looked vulnerable two out. However, her stamina kicked in nearing the last and it was a clear personal-best.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Blameitalonmyroots</b> hit a flat spot at the bottom of the home straight and is a touch flattered by her finishing position, but this was a sound effort off her 6lb higher mark. She&acute;ll likely peak when sent chasing down the line.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Dardanella</b>, whose powerful yard won this last year, cruised into contention and looked the one to side with. She emptied in between the final two flights, though, and found the trip too demanding. There must be another one of these in her soon.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Cannon Fodder</b> failed to raise her game for the return to quicker going on this drop down from a Grade 2. [David Orton]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> The switch to this track has really helped and the hill plays to <b class="black">Tara Tavey&acute;s</b> strengths. She&acute;s tough and honest and like a good test - Conor Smith, rider. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>Rather lowly hurdles form.<br /><br /> <b class="black">FROZEN OVER</b>, off since November and a maiden over hurdles coming into the race, had finished runner-up in the race a year ago and just wore down the favourite, doing well considering he&acute;d suffered interference on the run to the last.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Vodka &acute;n Tonic</b>, expected to improve for the better ground, travelled well and looked all over the winner on the run to two out, but he didn&acute;t find quite as much as expected and was run out of it.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Shot In The Dark</b> couldn&acute;t pick up as well as the front pair but this was still a sound effort.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Barista</b> couldn&acute;t muster the pace to challenge, but is on his lowest mark so far over hurdles.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Flashman</b> was a bit disappointing, readily being dropped late on.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Hartside</b> simply failed to give his running, needing reminders and not picking up. [Mark Brown]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> <b class="black">Frozen Over</b> has had a wind operation since his last outing. We think the way to ride him is to come with one sustained run as he did there. - Chris Down, trainer. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>The bends had been moved out by a couple of metres. Tom Scudamore said of the ground: "It&acute;s quite fast - good to firm". The market leaders disappointed in this claimer and the form looks questionable.<br /><br /> <b class="black">STOW</b> had a bit to find at the weights and had to settle for taking a lead early, but he picked up strongly for pressure and held on well having got to the front coming to the last. This was his first success since taking the race a year earlier.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Jolly Roger</b> returned to form on this drop back down in grade, not giving in when passed by the winner and keeping on right the way to the line.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Sweet World</b> hadn&acute;t been on a racecourse since the summer of 2012. He was dismissed in the market, but actually made a really pleasing return, keeping on to finish clear of the disappointing market leaders. It&acute;s hoped he goes on from this.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Conducting</b>, tailed off after a very slow start on his recent return from a break at Southwell, stopped quickly once headed and proved disappointing in a race he should have been capable of winning.<br /><br /> <b class="black">While You Wait</b>, in good form on the Flat and a winner on each of his last two starts over hurdles, didn&acute;t find for pressure and clearly failed to give his running. Most of his best hurdles form has been on ground with some cut in it. [Mark Brown]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> As he gets older <b class="black">Stow</b> gets wiser and cuter so Tom had to get after him to get him interested. I thought he was beaten when the other horse went on but he has rallied really well. - Michael Blake, trainer. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>A modest mares&acute; hurdle. The strong market support for the winner proved justified.<br /><br /> <b class="black">SHE&acute;S DA ONE</b>, a 3m point winner on good ground, hadn&acute;t lived up to expectations in a bumper and a hurdle at Wincanton, but those runs had been on a soft surface and this daughter of Presenting proved a different proposition on the better going here. She&acute;s going to stay further and should be competitive in handicaps down the line.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Storming Strumpet</b> had run well on her hurdles debut at Exeter and again showed more than enough to suggest a small mares&acute; hurdle will come her way, keeping on well close home to retake second.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Dino Mite</b>, winner of a fillies&acute; juvenile hurdle over 2m1f at the course last time, had her chance and ran well in a better race under a penalty.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Bella</b>, a late faller at Taunton last time, couldn&acute;t race on with the principals, but this have helped restore some confidence and handicaps may be more her thing.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Bondi Mist</b> ran well to a point and is another type for low-grade handicaps. [Mark Brown]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> <b class="black">She&acute;s Da One</b> wants this decent ground and, with that in mind, she will carry on now. She could well go novice chasing over the summer as she won a point in Ireland. - Paul Nicholls , trainer. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>No great depth to this novice hurdle and the proven performer in the field justified favouritism. The last hurdle had to be omitted.<br /><br /> <b class="black">MISTER GREZ</b> recorded a fourth win of the season and second over hurdles since the turn of the year. Although the ground may have been faster than ideal, and the trip on the sharp, he galloped on relentlessly, helped by the runner-up hanging under pressure, and remains in fine form.<br /><br /> <b class="black">The Outlaw</b> failed to settle on this hurdles debut, but he was finding for pressure until hanging badly left and ending up near to the stands&acute; rail. He probably wasn&acute;t helped by having to go around the last, but clearly has the basic ability to win a minor hurdle.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Say My Name</b> got closer to the winner than on his hurdles debut, possibly being helped by the better ground, and he remains of further progress.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Sparkling Ice</b> is now qualified for handicaps and should fare better in that sphere.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Do We Like Him</b>, like his stablemate The Outlaw, travelled well on this hurdles debut, but he failed to find for pressure and dropped out.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Mount Shamsan</b>, a promising sort on the Flat, rated 83, had joined new connections for 22,000gns, but he was weak in the market ahead of this hurdles debut and ran moderately. [Mark Brown]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> That ground was probably as fast as <b class="black">Mister Grez</b> wants and it will probably have to rain before he runs again this time. - Harry Skelton, representing his brother Dan. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>A modest handicap chase in which the three chasing debutants all came down.<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUITE BY CHANCE</b>, 3lb above his last win mark but back on his favoured good ground, put in a sound round of jumping, in contrast to his opponents, and was looking the likeliest winner anyway when left clear by the fall of Georgie Lad three out. Clearly suited by the longer trip, he can remain competitive providing he isn&acute;t put up too much.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Makadamia</b>, up 7lb for winning at Wetherby, proved disappointing in the first-time cheekpieces, failing to pick up for pressure and being fortunate to inherit second. This clearly wasn&acute;t her true form.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Georgie Lad</b>, a 3m point winner who didn&acute;t achive much over hurdles, was in the process of running a much better race on this debut over fences and was still in with a chance when coming down three out. He shouldn&acute;t have any trouble winning something similar providing his confidence isn&acute;t damaged.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Barton Rose</b>, another making her debut over fences, came down too far out to accurately tell how she&acute;d have fared, although other were going better at the time.<br /><br /> <b class="black">Taradrewe</b> departed early on this chasing debut, parting ways with her rider after a bad early blunder. [Mark Brown]<br /><br /> <b class="black">QUOTES</b> The step up to three miles seemed to suit <b class="black">Quite By Chance</b> on the faster ground. The race fell apart behind him but he jumped pretty well. - Colin Tizzard&acute;s son and assistant Joe. <br /><br /> <div id="resultRaceReport" class="hide"></div>
